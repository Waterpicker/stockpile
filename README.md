## Project Status

Unfortunately I'm no longer able or willing to maintain Stockpile on a regular basis. I'd be happy to transfer the repo and Curse page if any maintainers are interested (inquire in a GitHub issue).

Patches under version 1.1 may still be made to preserve worlds in the event of game-crashing bugs and conflicts. The original README text follows below.

> A Minecraft mod all about storage.

## Releases

Stable releases of Stockpile, built from the `master` branch, are available on
[CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/stockpile/files).

Versioned releases are also automatically pushed to GitHub Releases, however these may have remapping issues (i.e.
errors about classes not being found). Before opening an issue please make sure that you've tried the CurseForge
version.
